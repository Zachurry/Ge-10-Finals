                        <h2>CCS Acquaintance Party</h2>
                        <p>On September 28, 2024, our college held an acquaintance party with the theme "Mafia." The event took place at the elementary grounds and was designed to help students and faculty build connections in a fun and interactive setting. My role during the event was to serve food, ensuring that attendees were well-fed and satisfied throughout the celebration. I worked alongside others like staff from the cafeteria and my other committee members.
                            Participating in this event taught me the importance of teamwork and attention to detail in event organization. I initially expected the party to be just another formal gathering, but the themed activities and interactions made it much more exciting and memorable. I was particularly surprised by people wearing costumes like batman and joker.
                            
                            One individual who left a strong impression on me was Franz when he was hosting. His energy and heart that he put into making sure the participants were having fun made the experience more meaningful. While the most satisfying part of my role was seeing attendees enjoy the food and camaraderie, the most challenging part was the amount of people as many tables who haven’t been called stood up to get food and we had to explain to them to wait their turn. This activity highlighted my values of hospitality and service as I contributed to the event's success.
                            
                            This experience reinforced the importance of creating spaces where people can connect and have fun. I learned how to manage a line better, and I plan to apply this by helping out in future events.
                            
                            I would love to stay involved in organizing and participating in similar events, as they help strengthen relationships and build a sense of belonging. The benefits of this activity were clear, it fostered a lively and inclusive environment for everyone. If I were to do this again, I would plan ahead to streamline service and engage more with attendees because it is an acquaintance party after all.
                            
                            Because of this activity, I am more aware of how small acts of service can contribute to the joy and success of community events.

                        <h2>Parade of lights</h2>
                        <p>On August 19, 2024, I attended the Parade of Lights at Silliman University, marking the opening of Hibalag. The parade was a vibrant display of creativity and unity, showcasing illuminated props and participants representing various organizations. The event took place in the evening, drawing a crowd of students, faculty, alumni, and community members. My role was as a spectator, enjoying the lively atmosphere and the impressive displays that highlighted the spirit of Silliman.
                            Watching the Parade of Lights was a unique and inspiring experience. I had initially expected it to be a simple parade, but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of artistry and effort that went into the props and performances. The energy of the participants created a festive and uplifting atmosphere.
                            
                            The most satisfying part of the evening was witnessing the strong sense of community and pride among everyone present. However, navigating the large crowd was a bit challenging, but it was worth it to see the spectacular displays.
                            
                            The experience reflected my values of community, as I was reminded of the importance of coming together to celebrate shared traditions.
                            This experience gave me a deeper appreciation for how events like the Parade of Lights bring people together and celebrate the rich traditions of Silliman University. I learned collaboration and creativity. Moving forward, I hope to contribute to or participate in similar events to keep these traditions alive.
                            
                            The parade’s benefits were clear, it showcased talent, fostered school pride, and created lasting memories for all attendees. If I could relive the event, I might join an org and participate in the parade.
                            Because of this activity, I am more connected to the traditions and vibrant community spirit of Silliman University.

                        <h2>Paradia Sillimaniana</h2>
                        <p>On August 26, 2024, I participated as a drummer for the Silliman College of Computer Studies during the Parada Sillimaniana. This parade, part of Silliman University’s Founders Day celebrations, showcased vibrant floats and lively performances, with the colleges embracing a sort of 80s inspired theme bringing together students, faculty, and alumni in a festive display of creativity and school spirit. My role as a drummer involved setting the rhythm for our group, energizing both participants and spectators alike.
                            Being part of the Parada Sillimaniana was both challenging and rewarding. I initially expected it to be a straightforward parade performance, but I soon realized the effort required to stay in sync while keeping the energy high throughout the route. One surprising moment was when Bon wore a horse mask and it made it very funny and lively during the parade.
                            The most satisfying part of the event was being able to make it to the end, while the most challenging aspect was maintaining stamina while being on beat as we had to run in some parts. This activity allowed me to express values of teamwork and creativity, or dedication as I contributed to representing our college.
                            This experience has deepened my appreciation for the role of music and performance in creating a festive and unified atmosphere. I learned the importance of collaboration and maintaining focus in high energy situations. Moving forward, I hope to continue participating in events that showcase school spirit and creativity.
                            
                            The parade’s benefits were clear to me, it fostered camaraderie, showcased talent, and strengthened the sense of community within Silliman. If I could do it again, I would practice more as I joined at the last minute on a whim.

                        <h2>Entrepeneurship Fair </h2>
                        <p>On November 28, 2024, I passed by the senior high school's entrepreneurship fair beside the gym. The fair showcased various creative and innovative business ideas and products developed by senior high school students. While I didn’t actively participate, observing the event allowed me to get a glimpse of their entrepreneurial spirit and efforts to apply their learning in a practical setting.

                            Although I wasn’t deeply involved, walking through the fair gave me an appreciation for the students' creativity and effort. I was particularly impressed by the products, ideas, and concepts that the senior high school’s students came up with. It surprised me to see how well the students had thought out their concepts and engaged visitors with their presentations. The most satisfying aspect of passing by the fair was witnessing the confidence and innovation of the participants.
                            This experience reminded me of the importance of practical learning and the value of entrepreneurial skills in real-world settings. I realized that such initiatives not only enhance students' creativity but also build their confidence and communication skills. Moving forward, I’m inspired to explore similar activities or support such events more actively.
                            
                            The fair clearly had benefits for both the students and the audience. It provided a platform for showcasing ideas while inspiring others to think creatively. If I had the chance to revisit the event, I would definitely buy something from the booths.

                        <h2>Freshie Walk</h2>
                        <p>On August 15, 2024, I participated in the Freshie Walk, an event organized by the Silliman University Student Government (SUSG) for freshmen. The activity involved a symbolic walk to the amphitheater, followed by a quick worship session and a motivational talk. Afterward, we were treated to ice cream and had the chance to interact with fellow freshmen. This event aimed to welcome us to the university community and foster a sense of belonging.
                            Joining the Freshie Walk was both exciting and meaningful. I expected it to be a simple orientation activity, but it turned out to be a memorable introduction to the Silliman spirit. I was particularly surprised by the presentations of the different colleges and how they were able to make chants in a quick amount of time.
                            The most satisfying part was the chance to meet and connect with other freshmen, while the venue was really hot presented a slight challenge. The activity expressed values of unity and community as it brought everyone together in a meaningful way.
                            This experience helped me appreciate the effort that goes into creating a welcoming environment for new students. I learned the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone to engage with others, and I plan to continue building connections within the university community.
                            Because of this activity, I am more connected to the Silliman community and excited to grow alongside my fellow freshmen.

                        <p>On August 29, 2024, I attended Rock Against Youth Apathy, an event held during the closing of Hibalag at Silliman University. The concert showcased various bands, including Projecto, whose bassist happens to be a friend of mine. The event aimed to inspire youth engagement through music and create a vibrant conclusion to the week-long celebration of Hibalag. My role was as a spectator, enjoying the energetic performances and the lively atmosphere.
                            Watching Rock Against Youth Apathy was an exhilarating experience. I expected it to be a typical concert, but the energy and passion of the bands, especially Projecto, exceeded my expectations. Seeing my friend perform as the bassist added a personal connection to the event, making it even more memorable.
                            This activity reflected my values of friendship as I felt pride in supporting my friend and to be part of the event. This experience deepened my appreciation for the power of music in uniting people and raising awareness about important issues. Moving forward, I aim to support similar events and encourage creative expression among my peers.
                            Because of this activity, I am more inspired to support local music and actively participate in events that promote positive change.

                        <p>On December 14, 2024, our department hosted a Christmas party filled with laughter and camaraderie. The event took place at SU hall and featured a variety of fun games such as Trip to Jerusalem, Bring Me, and Shake That Cake, where participants shook their bodies to remove balls from a box attached to their backs. My role during the celebration was to serve food, ensuring that everyone enjoyed a delicious meal while participating in the activities.
                            This event was a joyful reminder of the importance of celebrating togetherness and community. My initial expectation was that it would be a typical holiday gathering, but the creative and energetic games made it uniquely entertaining. I was surprised by how much laughter and excitement the game Shake That Cake brought to the participants and audience alike. The most satisfying part of the celebration was seeing everyone genuinely enjoy themselves, while the most challenging aspect was the food service as the set b table ran out of food. This experience aligned with my values of hospitality and teamwork, as I contributed to making the event successful and enjoyable.
                            This experience reinforced the value of celebrating milestones and fostering connections within a community. I learned the importance of balancing work and play, and I plan to apply this by encouraging similar events that bring people together.
                            Because of this activity, I am more motivated to create and participate in events that celebrate culture and shared joy.
