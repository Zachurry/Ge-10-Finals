                        <p>The Silliman University Church traces its origins to the arrival of American Presbyterian missionaries in the Philippines in 1899, with the founding of Silliman Institute in 1901. Initially, services were held alongside the school’s first classes, and by 1911, the Presbyterian Church of Dumaguete was officially established, later becoming the Dumaguete Evangelical Church. Due to differing needs and languages between the town and school congregations, the two separated in 1916, forming the Silliman Student Church, which evolved into the Silliman University Church. Focused on ministering to students, faculty, and alumni of diverse faiths, the church emphasizes evangelistic witness, spiritual growth, and translating faith into action while respecting individual religious practices.</p>

                        <h2>Hibalag Opening Worship</h2>
                        <p>On August 19, 2024, our college organized an opening devotion for Silliman University's Hibalag at the SU Church. The event marked the beginning of the university's celebration and brought together students, faculty, and staff for a meaningful spiritual gathering. After the devotion, I contributed by helping serve food to participants at ATA Hall, working alongside other committee members.
                            Through this activity, I learned the importance of teamwork and hospitality. Initially, I expected a routine devotion and serving task, but the experience turned out to be more fulfilling than anticipated. What surprised me most was that it was different from a catholic mass which I am accustomed to but it was a nice experience overall
                            One person or group rather that left a strong impression on me was the council. I admired the work they put in to make it a successful event. The most satisfying part of the activity was serving the attendees, as it gave me a sense of contribution to the event’s success. It also gave me an opportunity to see who I will be interacting with during my time here
                            This activity allowed me to express values of service, community, and faith as I actively engaged in helping others and supporting the college’s efforts.
                            Because of this activity, I am more aware of the importance of service and the role it plays in building a sense of community.

                        <h2>Grand Alumni Homecoming Eucharistic Celebration</h2>
                        <p>On October 26, 2024, I served as part of the technical team during the Grand Alumni Homecoming Eucharistic Celebration. The event was held at St Paul University Dumaguete, bringing together alumni and guests to celebrate their shared connection to the university. My role involved managing the sound systems, ensuring that the program ran smoothly. I collaborated with the Paulinian Noble Society to aid in other aspects such as lighting and other things.
                            This activity allowed me to enhance my technical skills, particularly in managing sound systems. Initially, I expected the event to be straightforward, but it proved to be more dynamic and challenging due to some microphones not working or the priests voice not being loud enough. One aspect that surprised me was the number of alumni our school produced and how there are many more people before me and how much I could learn from them.
                            
                            A person who left a strong impression on me was n alumnus. Their age stood out, making me appreciate how no matter how old I get I can still remember my roots and still appreciate where I’ve come from. 
                            Being part of this event has broadened my understanding of how technical work supports the overall success of large gatherings which I can apply in future projects by doing the same things.
                            
                            I would like to continue supporting similar events in the future, as they provide opportunities to grow professionally and contribute to significant occasions. The benefits of this activity are clear—it fosters community, celebrates milestones, and sharpens my technical expertise. If given the chance to do this project again, I would definitely be more prepared.
                            Because of this activity, I am more confident in my ability to handle technical responsibilities during large-scale events.

                        <h2>Eucharistic Celebration with Papal Nuncio</h2>
                        <p>On October 27, 2024, The Papal Nuncio His Excellency, The Most Reverend Charles John Brown arrived at St. Paul University Dumaguete. This event is important because one of the leaders of our faith has come to Dumaguete to celebrate mass for the 120th Founders Celebration in St. Paul University Dumaguete. I listened and internalized the things he said during his homily. 
                            At first, I thought that it would be just like any other mass but the way that our papal nuncio holds mass really makes you listen and think about the people around us, our surroundings, and the significance of the event being held at that day. 
                            This activity shows the value of faith and community as it really has brought us Paulinians closer together through the wisdom of His Excellency, Most Reverend Fr. Charles Brown.
                        Because of this activity I am more appreciative of my faith and it’s impact on the lives of myself and others.

                        <h2>UCLEM Midweek Worship</h2>
                        <p>On November 20, 2024, The university had a midweek convocation where different departments come together for a quick service and praise. This activity really helped foster a sense of togetherness as different colleges came together and took an hour or so of their day to praise the Lord. 
                            This activity allowed us to come together and praise and worship the Lord even in the middle of the week. This shows that even though we are busy with our classes or other obligations we can still make time in the middle of lives for the Lord.
                        The thing that surprised me was the amount of attendees there were. Even though attendance was required for some the amount of people that attended even though they weren’t was still a lot. 
                        This activity really shows the faith and love that us Sillimanians have for our Lord and savior Jesus Christ.
                        Because of this activity, I am able to see that I can always make time for the Lord.

                        <h2>Galilean Fellowship</h2>
                        <p>On November 19, 2024 we attended the Galilean Fellowship during the UCLEM. The event was held to foster camaraderie and togetherness through discussing our problems which they called life’s giants. At the beginning they told each one of us to reach into a paper bag they had prepared up front. Each one of us was skeptical not knowing what was in the bag so we introduced ourselves, reached into the bag, and went back to our seats. What was important wasn’t what was in the bag but rather our bravery for reaching into it despite not knowing anything.
                            Through this activity we learned that despite life’s giants we must be like David the shepherd boy who didn’t falter in the face of Goliath but faced him head on with his faith in God. 
                            The speaker really left an impression on me as he told his story about being a teacher in his last year of college and he left it all to follow in the footsteps of the Lord. 
                            This activity allowed me to really get to know and strengthen my faith together with others through fun activities.
                            Because of this activity, I enhanced my faith in the Lord in order to conquer life’s giants.

                        <h2>UCLEM Closing Worship</h2>
                        <p>The UCLEM closing worship was help on November 27, 2024 this event marked the end of the UCLEM where for a month the university focuses on Christian Living where we reconnect and rekindle our relationship with the Lord. I attended the closing worship as a way to cap off a month of praise and worship. 
                            Through this activity I learned that even though it was for a month I and others like me were able to strengthen and others explore their faith in the Lord. The activities throughout the month were nice such as the Galilean Fellowship where we learned many things such as conquering our life’s giants.
                            I was expecting the activities to be a bore where I don’t learn anything new as I come from a religious school but I was gravely mistaken as the UCLEM gave me a different perspective on how I view God and our Lord Jesus Christ. 
                            Because of this activity I am more faithful and better understand my faith in God.
