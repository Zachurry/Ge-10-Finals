My role involved ensuring that attendees were properly recorded as part of the attendance committee. 
                            Being part of the event allowed me to witness firsthand the impact of alumni returning to share their experiences and expertise. I was initially unsure of what to expect, but the engaging and informative nature of the lecture exceeded my expectations. The most surprising aspect was the alumni’s passion and dedication to giving back to the community that nurtured them.
                            The most satisfying part of the experience was seeing students actively participate and ask questions, while the most challenging aspect was the amount of people who had trouble signing in but we powered through it. This activity reinforced my values of continuous learning as it highlighted the importance of sharing knowledge and experiences.

                        <h2>Guidance Orientation</h2>
                        <p>On August 21, 2024, I served as attendance committee for a guidance orientation organized for the College of Computer Studies (CCS). The event featured interactive activities such as a rock-paper-scissors evolution game and a teamwork exercise where we had to form shapes as a group while blindfolded and unable to talk. These games were designed to build camaraderie and communication skills among participants. Afterward, we had a discussion about the role of the guidance office in CCS and how their services can support us as students.
                            The guidance orientation was a refreshing and engaging way to introduce us to the support systems available in CCS. Initially, I expected a formal session, but the incorporation of games made it more interactive and enjoyable. One memorable moment was during the blindfolded group activity, where someone led the group effectively and everyone worked silently but in sync. This activity highlighted the importance of non-verbal communication and trust.
                            This orientation emphasized the importance of guidance services and how they can help us navigate both academic and personal challenges. Moving forward, I intend to make use of the guidance services when needed and encourage my peers to do the same. The benefits of this activity were clear, it combined fun with learning and provided practical insights into how we can rely on the guidance office for support. 
                            Because of this activity, I am more aware of the resources available to support my growth and motivated to build stronger connections with my fellow students in CCS.

                        <p>On October 14, 2024, I attended the All-University Academic Convocation held at the Luce Auditorium as an audience member. The event featured motivational speeches by university officials and aimed to inspire students and faculty to uphold the institution’s commitment to academic excellence.
                            This activity emphasized the value of hard work and dedication in academics.

One of the most impactful moments was the reminder not to rest on past achievements but to strive for continued growth.
                            The emphasis on humility and perseverance resonated deeply with me, as it highlighted the university’s pursuit of greater success. The event also reinforced my pride in being part of a school known for its strong academic reputation.
                            This experience encouraged me to remain committed to excelling in my academic endeavors and to support others in achieving their goals. It motivated me to push beyond my limits and contribute to society through knowledge and service. Moving forward, I aim to embody the values of perseverance and humility in my journey as a student.
                            Because of this activity, I am more determined to strive for academic excellence and help create a positive impact within my community.

                        <h2>CCS Freshman Orientation</h2>
                        <p>On September 18, 2024, I participated in the CCS Freshman Orientation, organized by the Confederates Student Council. The event aimed to welcome and introduce new students to the university’s academic programs, extracurricular opportunities, and campus life. My role was as a member of the Food Committee, where I assisted in the preparation and organization of meals and snacks for the participants. Alongside other committee members, we ensured that snacks were ready and accessible after the event to enhance the overall experience for the attendees.
                            This experience taught me valuable skills in organization and teamwork. Although I initially thought the task would be straightforward, I quickly realized the level of coordination and effort required to serve a large group efficiently. From setting up food stations to managing time constraints, the activity demanded clear communication and collaboration among the team.
                            The most fulfilling aspect of this role was seeing the freshmen enjoy the food and how it contributed to their positive experience of the orientation. Their smiles and appreciation highlighted the significance of even small details in making an event successful. This reinforced the importance of meticulous planning and teamwork in creating a welcoming and enjoyable environment.
                            Participating in the Freshman Orientation deepened my appreciation for the collaborative effort that goes into organizing successful events. It inspired me to take on similar roles in the future and contribute to initiatives that make a difference for others. Moving forward, I plan to apply the skills I gained to other activities, focusing on teamwork, attention to detail, and ensuring smooth execution.
                            This experience also showed me the impact of community-building events, encouraging me to actively support efforts that foster a sense of belonging among students. If I were to do this again, I would look for ways to improve efficiency in food distribution and possibly explore additional ways to enhance the participants’ experience, such as incorporating creative food presentations or interactive meal stations.
                            Because of this activity, I am more confident in my ability to contribute to event planning and inspired to play a more active role in creating positive experiences for others.

                        <p>On September 11, 2024, I attended the University-Wide Orientation. This event introduced students to the various services and facilities offered by the university, including guidance services, dormitories, and important school policies. The session aimed to familiarize students with the resources available to them and provide essential information to ensure a smooth and productive academic journey. As a participant, I gained valuable insights into the support systems the university has in place to assist students in their academic and personal growth.
                            This orientation was an eye-opening experience, as it helped me better understand the comprehensive support the university provides for its students. I expected a general overview of services, but I was pleasantly surprised by the detailed explanations and the emphasis on how these services are tailored to address students' needs. 
                            One aspect that stood out to me was the focus on guidance services and how they play a significant role in supporting students' mental health and well-being. I appreciated learning about the dormitory policies, which ensure a safe and conducive environment for those living on campus. The most impactful part of the session was realizing the accessibility of these resources, which made me feel more confident in seeking help if needed.
                            The orientation inspired me to take full advantage of the university's resources and encouraged me to share this information with fellow students who might benefit from these services. I realized the importance of being proactive in seeking help and utilizing the available facilities to enhance my academic and personal growth.
