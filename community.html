                        <p>At Silliman University, the value of community extends beyond the classroom to encompass a strong sense of belonging and mutual support. The university fosters an environment where students, faculty, and staff work together as a close-knit family, united by a shared mission of academic excellence and social responsibility. This spirit of collaboration and service is evident in various campus activities, outreach programs, and partnerships that encourage students to engage with the wider community. Silliman nurtures a culture of respect, inclusivity, and care, where individuals from diverse backgrounds are welcomed and valued. By emphasizing community, Silliman not only prepares students to succeed academically but also empowers them to make meaningful contributions to society, driven by a sense of responsibility and compassion for others.</p>

                        <h2>Ding ibato! Dodgeball for a cause</h2>
                        <p>On November 13, 2024, I participated in the Ding Ibato! Dodgeball for a cause held by DOST SA SU. The activity was for the animals in the community where the proceeds would go towards their food, shelter, or adoption. This event was a match made in heaven for people like me who are fond of animals and I advocate strongly for their wellbeing.

                            Through this activity I learned the importance of teamwork and the drive to do something for the greater good. I expected to just join and play for fun while helping contribute to a greater cause but I didnâ€™t expect to win. Due to the exceptional performance of our team, we were able to secure the 1st place and winning the event.
                        This activity allowed me to express my love for animals and the need for contributing to a greater cause.
                        Because of this activity, I am more cooperative and learned to work with a team to contribute to the greater good.

                        <h2>FPBC Feeding program</h2>
                        <p>On November 12, 2024, I helped organize a Feeding program held by FPBC at an elementary school in Sibulan. This event was held in the hope that we can give back to the community that we live in and to help foster the development of the youth that they may grow to be capable members of society. 
                            The activities we held aside from feeding were games and helping them with their problems through interacting with them like talking about school and other topics that they were interested in. I expected it to be an easy job sub-organizing an event but the issues we encountered during the logistics of the event were tough to deal with and not to mention how we got to and from there with the food and activities.
                        A person that left an impression on me was the teacher who was able to reign in that many children. Though I was not able to go there as I had class I wanted to be able to interact with the kids as I wanted to be able to reminisce about the time I was their age and wanted to compare myself then and the children of today.
                        This activity helped me learn more about the value of community and how to help others and support the children today to create a better tomorrow.
                        Because of this activity, I am more empowered to help my community through different events.

                        <h2>FPBC Beach Cleaning</h2>
                        <p>On November 17,2024 FPBC organized a Beach Cleaning Initiative at a beach in Sibulan. After getting permission from the barangay the organizers told us that we can start cleaning the beach. This event was held in the hopes that we can preserve the beach for future generations to use and also raise awareness of the effects of pollution on the environment. 
                            Through this activity I learned the importance of teamwork as its impossible to be able to clean a beach on your own. I expected it to be quick and easy to clean the beach but I underestimated the amount of garbage and litter in the sand there was. Thankfully there were plenty of us that were there so we were able to clean a portion of the beach effectively. 
                            This activity allowed me to express values of service and community as I actively work to make the world a better place.
                            Because of this activity, I am more aware of the importance of keeping our environment clean to keep our future alive.

                        <h2>Donation Drive for Bata ng Calabnugan</h2>
                        <p>On December 4, 2024 we went up to an orphanage in Calabnugan and donated an assortment of clothes, canned goods, fruits, and toiletries. This was held in hopes to give the orphanage aid and to support the children without their parents. During our stay there we were given a tour of the orphanage and how things work around there.
                            Through the activity I learned to humble myself and be grateful that I was given an opportunity in life to be with my parents unlike those that grew up without them or lost them. I initially thought that orphans lived a life that was tough and yes it is tough to grow without parents the orphanage workers or the house mothers really make it easier on the children and they get to live normal lives away from the streets.
                        A person that left an impact on me was the orphanage owner that was foreign. He was a police officer who had the opportunity to go to India and noticed the life of orphans there. Through the goodness of his heart he made orphanages there and here in the Philippines because his wife is a filipina from Calabnugan as well. The way he runs the orphanage is also awe inspiring as he made it mostly self sufficient through his planting of various fruits and vegetables as well as raising some livestock. Even though he could afford a lavish lifestyle here he chooses to live simple and give to the community, a true philanthropist. 
                        Because of this activity I am now aware of the problems that orphans may face and it has made me a more compassionate and understanding person.
